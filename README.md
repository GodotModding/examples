# Mod Loader Examples

This repo has a basic template you can reference when building your own mod. It has lots of comments to help you along the way.

The `root` folder is the same as the root folder in Godot's filesystem.

### Other Games

For other games, see the example mods on their own repo or GitHub organisation. Note that game-specific examples strip away the basics, so this example is always a great place to start.
